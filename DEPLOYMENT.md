cd "C:\Users\bjcor\Desktop\Coding Projects\Crowdin Post-Import Toolbox"

# Link to Railway (creates new project)
railway init

# When prompted:
# - Project name: crowdin-srx-automation
# - Environment: production
```

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

You'll need to set these variables in Railway. You can do this via CLI or Railway dashboard.

#### Option A: Via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [railway.app/dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your `crowdin-srx-automation` project
3. Click **"Variables"** tab
4. Add each variable below

#### Option B: Via CLI

```bash
# Crowdin OAuth Credentials (GET THESE FROM CROWDIN FIRST - see below)
railway variables set CROWDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
railway variables set CROWDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Application Configuration
railway variables set BASE_URL=https://crowdin-srx-automation-production.up.railway.app
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=3000

# Security Keys (generate strong random keys)

## üîê Setting Up Crowdin OAuth App (DO THIS FIRST!)

Before deploying, you need to create OAuth credentials in Crowdin Enterprise:

### Step 1: Access Organization Settings

1. Go to `https://strava.crowdin.com`
2. Click your profile icon (top right)
3. Navigate to **Organization Settings** ‚Üí **OAuth Apps**

### Step 2: Create New OAuth App

1. Click **"Create Application"** or **"New OAuth App"**
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: `Crowdin SRX Automation App`
   - **Description**: `Automatically configure SRX rules for XML files in Strava Project Group`
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://crowdin-srx-automation-production.up.railway.app`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://crowdin-srx-automation-production.up.railway.app/auth/callback`
   - **Logo**: Upload `resources/logo.png` (optional)

### Step 3: Save Credentials

1. After creating, you'll see:
   - **Client ID**: Something like `abc123def456`
   - **Client Secret**: Something like `xyz789uvw012` (KEEP THIS SECRET!)
2. Copy both values
3. Add them to Railway environment variables (see Step 4 above)

### Step 4: Update Callback URL (After First Deploy)

If your Railway URL is different:
1. Go back to OAuth app settings in Crowdin
2. Update **Authorization callback URL** with your actual Railway URL
3. Save changes

curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-01-10T..."}

# Check manifest
curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/manifest.json

# Should return JSON with app details
```

### Step 2: Install Custom App in Crowdin

1. Go to `https://strava.crowdin.com`
2. Navigate to **Organization Settings** ‚Üí **Apps** (or **Integrations**)
3. Click **"Install Custom App"** or **"Add Custom App"**
4. Enter your app's manifest URL:
   ```
   https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/manifest.json
   ```
5. Click **"Install"**

### Step 3: Authorize App Permissions

Review and authorize the requested permissions:
- ‚úÖ `project` - Access to projects
- ‚úÖ `project.file` - Read file information
- ‚úÖ `project.file.update` - Update file parser configuration
- ‚úÖ `project.group` - Access to project groups

Click **"Authorize"** to complete installation.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

1. The app should appear in your **Installed Apps** list
2. Navigate to any project in the Strava group
3. Look for **"SRX Automation"** in the integrations menu

3. **Check the file's parser configuration** in Crowdin:
   - Go to project ‚Üí Files
   - Click on the XML file
   - Check "File Settings" or "Parser Configuration"
   - Should include custom SRX rules
4. **Verify in logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs --filter "FileMonitoringService"
   ```

---

## üîß Railway Configuration Files

Railway auto-detects your project, but here's what it uses:

### `package.json` Scripts (Already Configured)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "nest build",
    "start:prod": "node dist/main",
    "start:dev": "nest start --watch"
  }
}
```

### Optional: Create `railway.toml` (Advanced)

If you need custom build/start commands:

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"
buildCommand = "npm install && npm run build"

[deploy]
startCommand = "npm run start:prod"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

---

## üí∞ Railway Pricing & Costs

### Free Tier

- **$5 free credit per month**
- **Usage-based**: $0.000231/GB-hour
- No credit card required to start

### Expected Costs for This App

| Resource | Usage | Cost/Month |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Memory** | ~512MB average | ~$4-5 |
| **CPU** | Light usage | ~$1-2 |
| **Network** | Minimal | <$1 |
| **Total** | | **~$5-7/month** |

**With $5 free credit**: **~$0-2/month actual cost**

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Enable sleep on inactivity** (if app isn't mission-critical 24/7):
   - Settings ‚Üí Sleep Mode
   - Wakes up on requests (adds ~5s latency)

2. **Use PostgreSQL add-on instead of SQLite** (for better persistence):
   - Railway PostgreSQL: Included in usage
   - More reliable than file-based SQLite

3. **Monitor usage regularly**:
   - Check Metrics tab
   - Set up billing alerts

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

- ‚úÖ **Never commit** `.env` files to Git
- ‚úÖ **Use strong secrets** for JWT and encryption keys
- ‚úÖ **Rotate secrets** periodically (every 90 days)
- ‚úÖ **Store secrets in Railway** only, not in code

### Database

- ‚úÖ **Regular backups**: Download SQLite file periodically
- ‚úÖ **Consider PostgreSQL**: For production, switch to Railway PostgreSQL
  ```bash
  # Add PostgreSQL to your project
  railway add postgresql
  
  # Update DB_TYPE in variables
  railway variables set DB_TYPE=postgres
  ```

### API Access

- ‚úÖ **Crowdin credentials**: Keep Client Secret secure
- ‚úÖ **Rate limiting**: Already configured in NestJS
- ‚úÖ **CORS**: Properly configured for Crowdin domains

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails

**Issue**: Build fails during `npm install` or `npm run build`

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs

# Common fixes:
# 1. Check Node.js version in package.json
# 2. Clear Railway cache
railway run npm cache clean --force
railway up

# 3. Verify dependencies
npm install
npm run build
```

### App Crashes on Startup

**Issue**: App starts but crashes immediately

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check logs for errors
railway logs --filter "error"

# Common causes:
# 1. Missing environment variables
railway variables

# 2. Database connection issues
railway variables set DB_DATABASE=/app/data/crowdin-app.db

# 3. Port configuration
railway variables set PORT=3000
```

### OAuth/Authentication Errors

**Issue**: Can't install app in Crowdin

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify OAuth credentials** match Crowdin:
   ```bash
   railway variables | grep CROWDIN_CLIENT
   ```

2. **Check callback URL** in Crowdin OAuth app settings:
   - Must exactly match: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/auth/callback`

3. **Verify manifest is accessible**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/manifest.json
   ```

### File Monitoring Not Working

**Issue**: SRX rules not being applied to XML files

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Check if monitoring is enabled
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/monitoring/status

# 2. Verify project group ID
railway variables | grep TARGET_PROJECT_GROUP

# 3. Check logs for errors
railway logs --filter "FileMonitoringService"

# 4. Manually trigger check
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/monitoring/check
```

### Database Issues

**Issue**: Data not persisting between deployments

**Solution**: Use Railway PostgreSQL instead of SQLite:
```bash
# Add PostgreSQL
railway add postgresql

# Update environment variables
railway variables set DB_TYPE=postgres
railway variables set DB_HOST=${{PGHOST}}
railway variables set DB_PORT=${{PGPORT}}
railway variables set DB_USERNAME=${{PGUSER}}
railway variables set DB_PASSWORD=${{PGPASSWORD}}
railway variables set DB_DATABASE=${{PGDATABASE}}
```

### Port Already in Use (Local Testing)

**Issue**: `EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or use different port locally
PORT=3001 npm run start:dev
```

---

## üîÑ Migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)

### Why PostgreSQL?

- ‚úÖ **Better persistence**: Data survives redeployments
- ‚úÖ **Better performance**: Faster queries, indexing
- ‚úÖ **Automatic backups**: Railway handles this
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Can handle more concurrent connections

### Migration Steps

1. **Add PostgreSQL to Railway**:
   ```bash
   railway add postgresql
   ```

2. **Update `package.json` dependencies**:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "pg": "^8.11.3",
       "typeorm": "^0.3.17"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update environment variables**:
   ```bash
   railway variables set DB_TYPE=postgres
   # Railway automatically provides: DATABASE_URL
   ```

4. **Update `src/config/typeorm-config.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   // Add PostgreSQL configuration
   if (this.configService.get('database.type') === 'postgres') {
     return {
       type: 'postgres',
       url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
       entities: [__dirname + '/../**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'],
       synchronize: this.configService.get('env') !== 'production',
       ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
     };
   }
   ```

5. **Deploy updated code**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Migrate to PostgreSQL"
   git push origin main
   railway up
   ```
